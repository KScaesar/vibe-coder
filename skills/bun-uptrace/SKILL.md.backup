# Bun-Uptrace Skill

Bun is a sql-first database client for go. this skill covers the comprehensive guide, querying, models, migrations, and postgresql specific features., generated from official documentation.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be triggered when:
- Working with bun-uptrace
- Asking about bun-uptrace features or APIs
- Implementing bun-uptrace solutions
- Debugging bun-uptrace code
- Learning bun-uptrace best practices

## Quick Reference

### Common Patterns

**Pattern 1:** # PostgreSQL data typestimestamptz vs timestampJSONBArraysUUIDSee also# timestamptz vs timestampTLDR You should prefer using timestamptz over times...

```
timestamptz
```

**Pattern 2:** Let's use the following table as an example:

```
CREATE TABLE test (
  t1 timestamptz,
  t2 timestamp
);
```

**Pattern 3:** # Logging queries# bundebugFor quick debugging, you can print executed queries to stdout

```
bundebug
```

**Pattern 4:** Example:

```
db := bun.NewDB(sqldb, dialect)

logger, err := zap.NewProduction()
db.AddQueryHook(bunzap.NewQueryHook(bunzap.QueryHookOptions{
    Logger:       logger,
    SlowDuration: 200 * time.Millisecond, // Omit to log all operations as debug
}))
```

**Pattern 5:** Golang Where PostgreSQL MySQLBasicsQueryBuilderWHERE INWherePKWHERE VALUESGrouping# BasicsYou can use arbitrary unsafe expressions in Where:q = q

```
Where
```

**Pattern 6:** # Writing complex parameterized queriesA parameterized query is a query that is built dynamically based on incoming request params

```
type ArticleFilter struct {
	CategoryID int64
	Search	   string
	Page	   int
}
```

### Example Code Patterns

**Example 1** (go):
```go
package migrations

import (
	"github.com/uptrace/bun/migrate"
)

// A collection of migrations.
var Migrations = migrate.NewMigrations()
```

**Example 2** (sql):
```sql
-- transaction 1
UPDATE test WHERE id IN (1, 2);

-- transaction 2
UPDATE test WHERE id IN (2, 1);
```

**Example 3** (sql):
```sql
-- transaction 1
UPDATE test WHERE id IN (1, 2);

-- transaction 2
UPDATE test WHERE id IN (1, 2);
```

**Example 4** (bash):
```bash
max_connections = <4-8 * number_of_cpus>
```

**Example 5** (bash):
```bash
shared_buffers = <20-40% of RAM>
```
